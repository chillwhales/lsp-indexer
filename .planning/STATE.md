## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

See `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table for full record.

**v1.1 decisions:**

- npm provenance via `npm config set provenance true` (avoids modifying changesets publish command)
- Docker image tagged with version from `publishedPackages[0].version` (fixed group ensures all packages share version)
- Preview releases use explicit package list (not glob) to exclude internal packages
- Shared CI/CD infra in chillwhales/.github org repo — reusable workflows consumed via `uses: chillwhales/.github/.github/workflows/*@main`, CI reduced from 9 inline jobs to 2 calls
- 4 packages: `@lsp-indexer/types`, `@lsp-indexer/node`, `@lsp-indexer/react`, `@lsp-indexer/next` in lsp-indexer monorepo
- Three consumption patterns: queries (TanStack Query via `@lsp-indexer/react`), subscriptions (graphql-ws), server actions (`'use server'` via `@lsp-indexer/next`)
- GraphQL codegen from Hasura schema, types committed to `packages/node`
- **Branch workflow: ALL v1.1 work merges via PRs to `refactor/indexer-v2-react`** — see PROJECT.md "Branching & PR Workflow" for full protocol
- Reference: `chillwhales/marketplace` graphql package and web hooks (being standardized)
- Vertical-slice approach: build Universal Profiles end-to-end first, then replicate across 10 domains
- Minimal runtime deps — only `graphql-ws` for subscriptions; typed fetch wrapper for queries (zero query deps)
- 4 separate packages replace old multi-entry-point approach: `@lsp-indexer/types` (was `/types`), `@lsp-indexer/node` (was `/server`), `@lsp-indexer/react` (hooks), `@lsp-indexer/next` (server actions)
- Parser layer transforms Hasura snake_case → clean camelCase types
- `graphql-ws` for WebSocket subscriptions (Hasura supports natively)
- `graphql` is devDependency only (codegen build-time, not shipped)
- Phase numbering continues from v1.0: Phases 7–11
- schema.graphql auto-generated from Hasura introspection via `pnpm schema:dump` (full 25k-line schema, not hand-maintained)
- Exports map uses split import/require conditions with separate .d.ts/.d.cts types
- typesVersions used for node10 resolution fallback
- treeshake disabled on tsup entries to preserve "use client" banner
- React 19 removes global JSX namespace — use React.ReactNode return types in components
- outputFileTracingRoot needed in next.config.ts for monorepo workspace root detection
- **UI: Always use shadcn/ui components over custom components** — Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (new-york style) is the standard for all UI in apps/test and future consumer apps. No inline styles, no custom components when a shadcn equivalent exists.
- Next.js 16 for test app (Turbopack default, React 19.2 canary features)
- Codegen always reads local schema.graphql (no env-var fallback branching)
- All image types (avatar, profileImage, backgroundImage) share ProfileImage interface with nullable width/height
- Structural interface for image parsing (avoids codegen \_\_typename incompatibility between profile_image and background_image)
- tokenOwned filter branches into owned_tokens (with tokenId) vs owned_assets (without tokenId)
- Destructure infinite query properties before rest spread to avoid TS2783 duplicate property errors
- **4-package architecture:** `@lsp-indexer/types` (Zod schemas, zero deps) ← `@lsp-indexer/node` (services, parsers, documents, codegen, keys, execute, errors) ← `@lsp-indexer/react` (thin TanStack Query hooks) and `@lsp-indexer/node` ← `@lsp-indexer/next` (server actions + hooks)
- **No re-exports across packages — single source of truth.** Each export lives in exactly one package. Consumers import from the source: types from `@lsp-indexer/types`, services/errors/keys from `@lsp-indexer/node`, hooks from `@lsp-indexer/react` or `@lsp-indexer/next`. No convenience re-exports, no barrel forwarding between packages.
- **Server actions use `'use server'` directive** — Next.js-only, hence `@lsp-indexer/next` package name
- **Hasura uses camelCase field names** (lsp3Profile, followedBy, ownedAssets) — not snake_case. Schema.graphql updated to match.
- **All address/tokenId comparisons use `_ilike`** for case-insensitive matching (EIP-55 mixed-case prevention)
- **Name sort uses `asc_nulls_last` / `desc_nulls_last`** — profiles without names sort last
- **Search inputs have 300ms debounce** — prevents excessive GraphQL queries
- **Labels on top of inputs** — not beside (consistent with shadcn form patterns)
- **Shared playground components** in `components/playground/` — FilterFieldsRow, SortControls, ResultsList<T>, useFilterFields, ErrorAlert, RawJsonToggle. New domains only need config arrays + domain card component.
- **Digital asset standard derivation:** parser derives `standard` from `decimals` field (3-state: undefined = not included → null, null = LSP8, value = LSP7)
- **tokenType raw mapping:** Hasura stores "0"/"1"/"2" strings → parser maps to TOKEN/NFT/COLLECTION
- **holderAddress filter:** maps to `ownedAssets.owner._ilike` (token holders via owned_asset.owner direct address field)
- **createdAt sort:** maps to `owner.timestamp` (contract owner timestamp = asset creation time, LOCKED)
- **@lukso/lsp4-contracts removed:** constants inlined in parser — dep was only needed for 3 integer values
- **SortNulls type + orderDir() helper:** `SortNulls = 'first' | 'last' | 'default'` in common.ts; `orderDir(direction, nulls)` maps to `asc_nulls_last` etc. — wired through all sort builders
- **Array fields `T[] | null`:** null = field not included in query, [] = fetched but empty — clean semantic distinction for include toggles
- **`export *` barrel pattern:** all package index.ts files use `export *` from domain files — eliminates per-export maintenance
- **`escapeLike` shared utility:** extracted to `packages/node/src/services/utils.ts` — applied to all string filter fields to prevent PostgreSQL LIKE wildcard injection (escapes `\`, `%`, `_`)
- **`numericToString` parser util:** in `packages/node/src/parsers/utils.ts` — safe Hasura `numeric` scalar handling (codegen types as string)
- **`formatTokenAmount` BigInt arithmetic:** `apps/test/src/lib/utils.ts` — avoids Number precision loss on uint256 values (bigintFixed, bigintCompact helpers)
- **Extracted domain card components:** `DigitalAssetCard`, `ProfileCard` as separate files in `apps/test/src/components/` — pages import, not define
- **`FilterFieldConfig.options[]`:** renders shadcn Select for enum fields (tokenType filter) — prevents invalid free-text values
- **Shared `parseImage` in `parsers/utils.ts`:** cross-domain LSP4 metadata image parsing — returns `Lsp4Image`, used by digital-assets and nfts parsers (no duplication)
- **NFT composite detail key:** `nftKeys.detail(address, tokenId)` — NFTs identified by (collectionAddress, tokenId) pair, not single address
- **Boolean filter `!== undefined` guard:** `isBurned`/`isMinted` filters use `!== undefined` to allow explicit `false` filtering
- **NFT lsp4Metadata + lsp4MetadataBaseUri dual sources:** parser checks direct metadata first → baseUri fallback second → null. Both are `lsp4_metadata` type with identical structure.
- **NFT holder vs owner:** `ownedToken.owner` = token holder (current possessor), NOT contract owner. Renamed to `holder`/`NftHolder` throughout for semantic clarity.
- **NFT collection = full DigitalAsset:** `digitalAsset` relation on NFT provides 20+ fields. Reuses `parseDigitalAsset` from digital-assets parser. `include.collection` is `DigitalAssetInclude` (17 sub-include variables).
- **NFT single lookup: tokenId OR formattedTokenId:** Not both required. Stacked vertical inputs in playground.
- **NFT name filter \_or search:** Name searches both `lsp4Metadata.name.value._ilike` and `lsp4MetadataBaseUri.name.value._ilike` using Hasura `_or` in where clause.
- **OwnedAsset.balance = z.bigint():** Hasura numeric → parser converts to BigInt. Consumer uses formatTokenAmount helpers.
- **OwnedAssetFilter: 4 string fields (owner, address, digitalAssetId, universalProfileId):** Balance/timestamp range filters deferred.
- **OwnedAssetSortField nested sorts:** `digitalAssetName` → `digitalAsset.lsp4TokenName`, `tokenIdCount` → `tokenIds_aggregate.count` at service layer.
- **Nested universalProfile: all LSP3 fields, no aggregates:** follower/following counts excluded from ownership context.
- **Cross-domain parser `as any` casts:** Nested sub-selections in owned_asset/owned_token documents omit fields (like `id`) that primary parsers expect. Safe because all parsers use optional chaining. Standard pattern for sub-selections.
- **Owned asset DA include vars reused directly:** Unlike NFT (prefixed `includeCollection*`), owned asset/token documents use same `include*` var names as DA document, so `buildDigitalAssetIncludeVars` output used directly.
- **Natural key lookup for playground single tab:** Uses holder+asset address via `useOwnedAssets({ filter, limit: 1 })` instead of opaque Hasura IDs — more developer-friendly
- **Preload prevention via limit:0:** When no query present, pass `limit: 0` to prevent hooks from firing on empty filter
- **Full addresses, no truncation:** Display full hex addresses with `break-all` CSS wrapping — user preference
- **Unified ghost Button collapsible triggers:** All card collapsible sections use `<Button variant="ghost" size="sm">` with icon + text + ChevronDown, matching RawJsonToggle style
- **NFT holder UP as full block:** ownedToken.universalProfile fetched as complete block (not per-field @include), parsed via `parseHolderProfile()` inline helper
- **NftCard section order:** Holder Profile → NFT Metadata → Collection (collection moved to last per user preference)
- **OwnedTokenNftIncludeSchema:** 8 per-field `@include` toggles for NFT metadata (NftInclude minus collection/holder which are sibling relations)
- **Conditional include types (DX-04):** Hook return types should be narrowed by `include` parameter — excluded fields absent from type, not `null`. Prisma-style `select`/`include` inference. Nested includes narrow recursively. Default (no include) returns full type. Research-first approach: design spike before implementation plans.
- **`IncludeResult<Full, Base, Map, I>` utility type:** Core type algebra in `include-types.ts` — maps include params to narrowed domain types. Uses `ActiveFields` helper with conditional mapped types. `const I` generic param preserves literal type inference.
- **`stripExcluded` runtime utility:** `parsers/strip.ts` — ensures Object.keys only returns included fields at runtime. Accepts `derivedFields` map for cross-field dependencies (e.g., digital asset `standard` derives from `decimals`).
- **`as ProfileResult<I>` cast pattern:** Service boundaries require explicit cast because parser returns full `Profile` type before runtime stripping. TypeScript can't infer `stripExcluded` narrows the type.
- **`DigitalAssetResult<I>` with `ResolveStandard<I>`:** Derived field pattern — `standard` follows `decimals` via intersection type `& ResolveStandard<NonNullable<I>>`. Runtime: `stripExcluded(result, include, ['address'], { standard: 'decimals' })`.
- **`as DigitalAssetResult<I>` cast pattern:** Same cast pattern as Profile — service boundaries cast parser output to narrowed generic type.
- **`NftResult<I>` with nested relation narrowing:** `ResolveNftCollection<I>` and `ResolveNftHolder<I>` intersection types use `I extends { field: infer C } ? C extends SubInclude ? { field: SubResult<C> | null } : {} : {}` pattern. Base fields: address, tokenId, isBurned, isMinted.
- **`OwnedAssetResult<I>` with nested relation narrowing:** `ResolveOwnedAssetDA<I>` and `ResolveOwnedAssetHolder<I>` intersection types. Base fields: id, digitalAssetAddress, holderAddress.
- **NftHolder = ProfileResult + timestamp:** Handled via `ProfileResult<H> & { timestamp: string }` intersection because NftHolder extends Profile with a timestamp.
- **Recursive nested stripping:** Parsers delegate to `parseDigitalAsset(raw, include?.collection)` and `parseProfile(raw, include?.holder)` with sub-include param — nested relations handled by their own parsers.
- **`OwnedTokenResult<I>` with 4 nested relation narrowing:** Most complex domain — `ResolveOwnedTokenDA<I>`, `ResolveOwnedTokenNft<I>`, `ResolveOwnedTokenOA<I>`, `ResolveOwnedTokenHolder<I>`. Custom scalar field maps for sub-domain contexts (OwnedTokenNftScalarFieldMap with 8 fields, OwnedTokenOwnedAssetFieldMap with 3 fields).
- **Sub-domain IncludeResult vs XResult:** NFT and OwnedAsset sub-contexts in owned-token use `IncludeResult<Nft/OwnedAsset>` directly (not `NftResult`/`OwnedAssetResult`) because collection/holder and digitalAsset/holder/tokenIdCount are unavailable in sub-selection context.
- **Card prop types as `Record<string, unknown>`:** Cards accept any subset of the full domain type. `'key' in obj` guards determine which sections render. Typed narrowing enforced at hook consumer level, not card level.
- **`as Record<string, unknown>` casts at page-card boundaries:** Pages cast narrowed `XResult<I>` types when passing to cards — single clean boundary between typed hook results and field-presence-based rendering.
- **Removed explicit `ResultsList<T>` generics:** Let TypeScript infer from `items` prop — avoids type mismatch when hooks return narrowed result types.
- **Follower domain `direction` param:** `fetchFollowers` accepts `direction: 'followers' | 'following'` to serve both useFollowers and useFollowing from a single service function. `direction: 'followers'` → `primaryField = 'followed_address'` (who follows X), `direction: 'following'` → `primaryField = 'follower_address'` (who X follows).
- **FollowerResult<I> with two profile sub-includes:** `ResolveFollowerProfile<I>` and `ResolveFollowedProfile<I>` intersection types narrow both nested profiles independently. Base fields: followerAddress, followedAddress.
- **buildFollowerIncludeVars prefix replacement:** Reuses `buildProfileIncludeVars` with `key.replace('includeProfile', 'includeFollowerProfile')` / `'includeFollowedProfile'` for nested profile variable mapping — same pattern as NFT collection.
- **FollowCount separate document:** `GetFollowCountDocument` uses two aliased `follower_aggregate` queries — one for follower count (where followed_address = X), one for following count (where follower_address = X).
- **fetchIsFollowing reuses list document:** No separate existence query — `GetFollowersDocument` with `limit: 1` and all includes disabled for minimal payload.
- **CreatorResult<I> with dual heterogeneous relation resolvers:** `ResolveCreatorProfile<I>` (ProfileResult) and `ResolveCreatorDigitalAsset<I>` (DigitalAssetResult) — each side independently narrowable. Base fields: creatorAddress, digitalAssetAddress.
- **Creator has no singular hook:** No natural key exists (opaque Hasura ID only) — only useCreators and useInfiniteCreators hooks
- **GetCreatorsDocument 31 include variables:** 3 scalar (arrayIndex, interfaceId, timestamp) + 10 creator profile ($includeCreatorProfile*) + 18 digital asset ($includeDigitalAsset\*) — all Boolean! = true defaults
- **Creator profile sub-fields:** followedBy_aggregate for follower count, following_aggregate for following count (matching established profile document pattern)
- **IssuedAssetResult<I> with ResolveIssuerProfile and ResolveIssuedAssetDigitalAsset:** Same dual heterogeneous relation pattern as Creator. Base fields: issuerAddress, assetAddress. Hasura uses `universalProfile` (not issuerProfile) and `issuedAsset` (not digitalAsset) — parser maps to domain names.
- **GetIssuedAssetsDocument 31 include variables:** 3 scalar (arrayIndex, interfaceId, timestamp) + 10 issuer profile ($includeIssuerProfile*) + 18 digital asset ($includeDigitalAsset\*) — all Boolean! = true defaults
- **Issuer profile uses `followed_aggregate`** (not `following_aggregate`) for following count — schema field name difference from other profile sub-documents
- **EncryptedAsset domain naming:** Type name `EncryptedAsset`, hooks `useEncryptedAssets`/`useInfiniteEncryptedAssets` — maps to Hasura `lsp29_encrypted_asset` table (rich metadata, NOT sparse `lsp29_encrypted_asset_entry`)
- **EncryptedAsset no singular hook:** No `useEncryptedAsset`. No reliable natural key exists (user-introduced elements can share address + contentId + revision) — same pattern as creators/issued assets
- **EncryptedAsset base fields:** `address`, `contentId`, `revision` — always present, everything else conditional via include
- **EncryptedAsset encryption sub-include:** `z.union([z.boolean(), EncryptedAssetEncryptionIncludeSchema])` — `true` = full with accessControlConditions, object `{ accessControlConditions: false }` = encryption scalars only, `false`/omitted = skip encryption
- **EncryptedAsset title/description flattening:** Hasura returns `{ title: { value: "..." } }` → parser flattens to `title: string | null`. Same for description.
- **LSP29 images separate from LSP4 images:** `EncryptedAssetImageSchema` has `imageIndex`, `verificationSource` fields that LSP4 images lack — separate schema and parser
- **ImageList reusable component:** Extracted duplicated image rendering from ProfileCard, DigitalAssetCard, NftCard. Accepts generic `{ url?: string | null; [key: string]: unknown }[]` shape. Backported to 3 existing cards.
- **EncryptedAsset numeric fields:** `array_index`, `file.last_modified`, `file.size`, `chunks.total_size` all Hasura `numeric` → `Number()` conversion in parser
- **EncryptedAsset 8 filter fields:** 3 nested relation filters (`universalProfile.lsp3Profile.name.value`, `encryption.method`, `file.type`), 1 numeric comparison (`file.size._gte`), 1 exact numeric (`revision._eq`), 1 timestamp (`_gte`), 2 string ilike
- **buildEncryptedAssetIncludeVars prefix replacement:** Reuses `buildProfileIncludeVars` with `key.replace('includeProfile', 'includeUniversalProfile')` — same prefix pattern as other domains with nested profiles
- **`followed_aggregate` for universalProfile following count:** Profile sub-document in encrypted assets uses `followed_aggregate` (matching issued assets pattern)
- **DataChangedEvent base fields:** address, dataKey, dataValue — dataKeyName is an includable field (parser-derived from resolveDataKeyName for known ERC725Y keys, null if unknown), NOT from Hasura
- **TokenIdDataChangedEvent base fields:** address, dataKey, dataValue, tokenId — dataKeyName is an includable field, same parser-derived resolution
- **TokenIdDataChangedEvent nft include:** `nft: z.union([z.boolean(), OwnedTokenNftIncludeSchema]).optional()` — accepts boolean for all fields or OwnedTokenNftInclude for per-field control. Full NftSchema used (not a lightweight sub-type)
- **Latest hooks for data changed events:** `useLatestDataChangedEvent` and `useLatestTokenIdDataChangedEvent` fetch most recent event by filter (timestamp desc, limit 1)
- **GetDataChangedEventsDocument 36 variables:** 4 pagination + 4 scalar + 10 UP ($includeUniversalProfile*) + 18 DA ($includeDigitalAsset\*)
- **GetTokenIdDataChangedEventsDocument 27 variables:** 4 pagination + 4 scalar + 18 DA ($includeDigitalAsset*) + 1 nft ($includeNft)
- **resolveDataKeyName utility:** In `@lsp-indexer/data-keys` package — reverse map from hex ERC725Y data key → human-readable name using 32 hardcoded built-in data keys. No @lukso/\* dependencies. Returns null for unknown keys. Prefix matching for array/mapping keys.
- **@lsp-indexer/data-keys package:** Standalone read-only registry with constants, registry, schemas (DataKeyNameSchema z.enum), types. Only dependency is zod.
- **NFT name filter in token-id-data-changed uses \_or pattern:** `{ nft: { _or: [{ lsp4Metadata: { name: { value: { _ilike } } } }, { lsp4MetadataBaseUri: { name: { value: { _ilike } } } }] } }` — matching nfts service pattern
- **Data changed event UP prefix: includeProfile* → includeUniversalProfile*:** Matching encrypted-assets pattern for nested UP sub-includes
  - **Data changed event DA prefix: include* → includeDigitalAsset*:** Matching issued-assets pattern for nested DA sub-includes
  - **dataKeyName display pattern:** Bold resolved name when known, "(Unknown Key)" in muted italic when null, raw hex truncated to 20 chars in mono below
  - **Data changed events 3-tab playground layout:** Data changed events domains have 3 tabs each (Latest, List, Infinite) — other event domains use 2 tabs (List, Infinite) when no latest hook exists
  - **nft include in scalar include array:** TokenIdDataChangedEvent nft is a boolean toggle in the playground UI (schema supports union type but playground uses simple on/off)
- **UniversalReceiverEvent 3-relation include pattern:** universalProfile (receiving UP), fromProfile (sender UP), fromAsset (sender DA) — most relation-heavy domain in the project (3 relations vs 2 for other dual-relation domains)
- **46 GraphQL variables — highest count in project:** 4 pagination + 4 scalar + 10 receiving UP ($includeUniversalProfile*) + 10 sender UP ($includeFromProfile*) + 18 sender DA ($includeFromAsset*) — all Boolean! = true defaults
- **Both UP sub-selections use `followed_aggregate`:** Receiving universalProfile and sender fromProfile both use `followed_aggregate` for following count — matching established pattern from data-changed-events, encrypted-assets, issued-assets
- **`value` field is Hasura `numeric`:** codegen types as string, parsed via `numericToString` — same pattern as encrypted asset numeric fields
- **`hideDirectionAndNulls` SortControls prop:** Boolean computed at usage site (`sortField === 'newest' || sortField === 'oldest'`) — hides Direction/Nulls dropdowns for self-describing sort fields. Keeps SortControls generic for non-event domains.
- **4-generic SubscriptionConfig<TResult, TVariables, TRaw, TParsed>:** Replaces old `SubscriptionConfig<T>` with typed `extract` function instead of string `dataKey`. TypedDocumentString carries type information from codegen through the entire data path. Config lives in `@lsp-indexer/node` (depends on TypedDocumentString); types package uses structural `{ toString(): string }` to avoid import.
- **graphql-ws generic threading:** `Client.subscribe<TResult>()` threads result type through sink — zero `as` casts in the subscription data path.
- **typesVersions for multi-entry packages:** @lsp-indexer/next needs typesVersions for node10 resolution of ./server sub-path entry — attw flagged NoResolution without it. Single-entry packages resolve via top-level `types` field.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 9.12 inserted after Phase 9.11: Block-Ordered Sorting — deterministic event ordering by blockNumber → transactionIndex → logIndex instead of timestamp (URGENT). Affects 4 event domains: followers (9.5), data-changed (9.10), token-id-data-changed (9.10), universal-receiver (9.11).
- Phase 12 added: Replace local `packages/data-keys/` and `packages/lsp1/` with `@chillwhales/erc725` and `@chillwhales/lsp1` npm packages. Extract reusable utilities as PRs to `chillwhales/LSPs`. Reduces local codebase, aligns with shared LUKSO Standards ecosystem.
- Phase 13 added: Indexer v1 cleanup — remove `packages/indexer/` (v1), promote `packages/indexer-v2/` to `packages/indexer/`, remove `docker/v1/`, update root scripts and configs. Eliminates all v1 remnants.
- Phase 14 added: Code comments cleanup & release prep — remove dead/outdated/.planning comments, add consumer-facing JSDoc to all public APIs, clean up test app documentation, final publish validation. Last phase before npm release.
- Phase 15 added: CI/CD workflows & shared infra — mirror `chillwhales/LSPs` CI pipeline (layered CI, changesets release, preview releases), investigate abstracting shared workflow patterns into a reusable third repo for cross-repo consistency.
- **vitest 4 API change:** `defineWorkspace` removed — use `vitest.config.ts` with `test.projects` array. Per-project coverage thresholds not enforced in projects mode; root-level coverage config needed for reporter output.
- **Changesets fixed group:** All 4 @lsp-indexer packages versioned together via `fixed` array in `.changeset/config.json`

## Session Continuity

### Last Session

- **Date:** 2026-03-08
- **Activity:** Executed 15-03: Shared infra — chillwhales/.github org repo with reusable workflows
- **Outcome:** chillwhales/.github created with 2 composite actions + 3 reusable workflows, lsp-indexer CI refactored to consume them, decision doc written
- **Resume file:** None

### Context for Next Session

- **Phase 15 complete** — All 3 plans done (CI pipeline, release/preview workflows, shared infra)
- **v1.1 milestone nearly complete** — all 46 requirements mapped, Phase 15 was final phase
- **chillwhales/.github** — org repo with reusable workflows, consumed by lsp-indexer
- **Pre-existing issue:** `packages/indexer` has pre-existing build errors (unrelated typeorm/abi issues) — build individual packages instead of `pnpm build`
- **Note:** vitest 4 changed API from `defineWorkspace` to `test.projects` — per-project coverage thresholds not yet enforced in projects mode
